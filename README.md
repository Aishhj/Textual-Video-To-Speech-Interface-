- Converts extracted text into speech using **gTTS**
- Web-based interface built with **Flask**
- Achieved **90% OCR accuracy** with optimized preprocessing
- Handles varied lighting conditions efficiently

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask  
- OpenCV, pytesseract  
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)  
- HTML, CSS
